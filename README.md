# Development

## Starting the app

```
npm start
```

## The build pipeline

Build process uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The entry-points are `src/background.js` and `src/app.js`. Webpack will follow all `import` statements starting from those files and compile code of the whole dependency tree into one `.js` file for each entry point.

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is also utilised, but mainly for its great error messages. Electron under the hood runs latest Chromium, hence most of the new JavaScript features are already natively supported.

## Environments

Environmental variables are done in a bit different way (not via `process.env`). Env files are plain JSONs in `config` directory, and build process dynamically links one of them as an `env` module. You can import it wherever in code you need access to the environment.
```js
import env from "env";
console.log(env.name);
```
# Testing

Run all tests:
```
npm test
```

## Unit

```
npm run unit
```
Using [electron-mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) test runner with the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) assertion library. You can put your spec files wherever you want within the `src` directory, just name them with the `.spec.js` extension.

## End to end

```
npm run e2e
```
Using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/). This task will run all files in `e2e` directory with `.e2e.js` extension.

# Making a release

To package your app into an installer use command:
```
npm run release
```
